Alpha-Beta-Pruning:
	
	MaxDepth = 1, NodesExpanded = 1
	MaxDepth = 2, NodesExpanded = 281
	MaxDepth = 3, NodesExpanded = 12865	

	Runtime = O(b^d)
	Space complexity = O(b^d)
	b is the possible moves and d is the depth

MiniMax (no pruning):
	
	MaxDepth = 1, NodesExpanded = 1
	MaxDepth = 2, NodesExpanded = 281
	MaxDepth = 3, NodesExpanded = 15460 

	Runtime = O(b^d)
	Space Complexity = O(b^d)
